In this project, you will use/write simple Python functions that generate logical sentences
describing Pacman physics, aka pacphysics, and the game Clue. You will use a SAT solver,
pycosat, to solve the logical inference tasks associated with planning (generating action
sequences to reach goal locations) and playing Clue.
