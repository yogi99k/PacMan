Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things are not always so. Legend has it that
many years ago, Pacman’s great-grandfather Grandpa learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However,
he was blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.
In this project, you will design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts.
You’ll advance from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts
with ruthless efficiency.
